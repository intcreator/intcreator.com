# Fine Print

Here are several important (though possibly boring) rules and disclaimers that you should be familiar with before using my services.

## Studio Rules

- No children under age 12 are allowed in the studio (unless they are participating in the recording)
- Clients are liable for damage they cause to studio equipment beyond normal wear and tear (charged in addition to studio time)

## Music Content Policy

I am committed to producing uplifting music.  I will not record, produce, mix, or master music that is profane, vulgar, violent, satanic, or sexual.  I may be able to recommend a different service you can utilize if your music fits into any of these categories.

I reserve the right to determine whether music fits into these categories.  I also reserve the right to stop working on a project if I don't immediately realize or decide a song is not appropriate.  If this is the case, clients may still be billed for recording or producing time, whether or not a finished product is created.

## Payment Policy

Account balances must be cleared for previous visits to the studio before additional visits to the studio may be scheduled.  Account balances must also be cleared for previous projects before additional projects may be started.

Updated files (in stems, progress mixes, etc.) will not be transferred to clients until their payments are up to date.

## Privacy Policy

I will not share or distribute your music or related material without your permission.  I will not publicize photos of you or your band without your permission.

## Copyright

Those who pay for studio time or production work own 100% of the copyright of the created works that would otherwise be owned by me.

This means that clients who do not pay in full for studio time or production work cannot claim copyright on created works.

This also means that artists who play or sing in the studio or who submit songs to be produced but have fees paid by a publisher or other third party surrender their copyright claim to the publisher or third party.

## Agreement

By using my services or my studio, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to the information on this page.  Upon beginning a project you will be asked to read and digitally sign a contract including these terms.
