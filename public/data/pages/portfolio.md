# Portfolio

Here are examples of different things I've made somewhat recently (as in 2016 or later).

## Interlucid

[Interlucid](https://interlucid.com/) is my interactive music experience project.

- [Web Audio API Tutorial](https://web-audio-api.firebaseapp.com/): dissatisfied with the lack of readable tutorials on the web audio API, I created my own tutorial site which includes small, easily copyable examples for each feature.

## BYU User Experience Design

I took a user experience design class at BYU and made the following app prototypes:

[](- [Twit Bot](/portfolio/twit-bot: a Twitter clone)
- [Someday Calculator](/portfolio/someday-calc): a retirement calculator that helps you understand the importance of saving starting now

## Personal Projects

- [Simple BYU](https://simple-byu.firebaseapp.com/): dissatisfied with the poor user experience of BYU's website, I created a new home page of my own that allows users to very quickly find what they need.
- [Enigma](/portfolio/enigma): I made an WWII Enigma emulator in C++ as my first project outside of a CS class and I rewrote it in ES6 for this site
- [This site](/): This site is an experiment and proving ground for my web design and implementation abilities
