# Portfolio

Here are examples of different things I've made somewhat recently (as in 2016 or later).

## BYU User Experience Design

I took a user experience design class at BYU and made the following app prototypes:

- [Twit Bot](/portfolio/twit-bot): a Twitter clone
- [Someday Calculator](/portfolio/someday-calc): a retirement calculator that helps you understand the importance of saving starting now

## Personal Projects

- [Enigma](/portfolio/enigma): I made an WWII Enigma emulator in C++ as my first project outside of a CS class and I rewrote it in ES6 for this site
- [This site](/): This site is an experiment and proving ground for my web design and implementation abilities
