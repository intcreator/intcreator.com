# Portfolio

Here are examples of different things I've made.

## BYU User Experience Design

I took a user experience design class at BYU and made the following app prototypes:

- [TwitBot](/portfolio/twitbot): a Twitter clone
- [Someday Calculator](/portfolio/someday-calc): a retirement calculator that helps you understand the importance of saving starting now

## Personal Projects

- [Enigma](/portfolio/enigma): I made an WWII Enigma emulator in C++ as my first project outside of a CS class and I rewrote it in ES6 for this site

## Legacy

These are the first websites I ever made (in 2010).  Don't judge my current capabilities based on what you see here.

- [Monolithic](/legacy/monolithic): A site I made for Monolithic, a one man synthpop band from Thousand Oaks, CA
- [CAMARinfO](/legacy/camarinfo): A site I made about Chevrolet Camaros
- [Light Matter](/legacy/light): A site I made for my band, then known as Light Matter (now [Interlucid](https://interlucid.com/))
- [Pixar](/legacy/pixar): A site I made about Pixar
- _[Saving Private Ryan](/legacy/ryan)_: A site I made for the movie _Saving Private Ryan_
- [Metalectricity](/legacy): A web and print design site I created as an early business venture
