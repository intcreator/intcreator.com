# About

My name is Brandon der Bl√§tter.  I'm a web developer.  

I studied computer science and music at BYU, and I've continued to learn independently as well.  I love user experience design and working with JavaScript.  Native web components are really cool.  I want to learn more about GraphQL and smart contracts.

You can find links to lots of things I'm interested in on the [home page](/).  For a journal-like history of my work experience, see my [curriculum vitae](/cv).  If you'd like to see some very old work that goes along with some of my CV, check out my [legacy projects](/legacy).

I also make music as [Interlucid](https://interlucid.com).
