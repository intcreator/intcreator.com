# About

My name is Brandon der Bl√§tter.  I'm a musician, web developer, and producer.  [Interlucid](https://interlucid.com) is my main music project.

This site is for my music production and artist identity business.  At BYU I studied computer science and music, and I've continued to learn independently as well.

You can find links to most of my life on the [legacy portfolio page](/legacy-portfolio).  For a journal-like history of my work experience, see my [curriculum vitae](/cv).  If you'd like to see some very old work that goes along with some of my CV, check out my [legacy projects](/legacy).
