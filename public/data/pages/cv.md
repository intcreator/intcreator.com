# Curriculum Vitae

This curriculum vitae details everything I have ever done, including small business ideas I had as a kid.  You can see some of the results of those ideas in my [legacy websites](/legacy).

## Gammex Games

Gammex Games is the first thing I decided to call my personal business.  My first idea was to have a website where people could play Flash games, similar to [onemorelevel.com](http://onemorelevel.com/).  I didn't even use my real name for this site.  I guess that's okay because I was only 15.

Amazingly, the site I made worked until around 2023. Google has stopped hosting classic sites, but you can see what it looked like [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20201103152431/https://sites.google.com/site/gammexgames/).  I made that site in 2008, which was a long time ago.

## Gammesoft

Gammesoft is mostly a variation and expansion of Gammex Games.  I decided to branch out a bit with my content (as you can kind of see on the Gammex Games site) but Gammesoft in general did not last long.

## Metalectricity

[Metalectricity](/legacy/metalectricity) is my first idea for a design and development contracting business.  I realized that was more realistic for me than creating or collecting Flash games and monetizing with ads.  As you can see I was more focused around visual design despite the terrible design of my example logos and websites and my clear ability to code as evidenced by me making a website.  Oh well.

## State Farm

I had a brief stint at two State Farm Agencies, one owned by my grandpa and one owned by my uncle.  This constitutes the closest thing I had to a first job.  I didn't do much more than create PowerPoints, scan documents, and generate some pretty easy reports though.

## Intcreator

This is my latest and most permanent identity (circa 2011).  I use this name as my online handle and as the closest semblance to a business (or possibly even a recording label for my band) whenever convenient.  Currently the most likely business I'll create will probably be centered around my music.

## ReWater

My first actual contracting job (think Metalectricity) was for [ReWater](http://rewater.com/), a greywater irrigation company based in my hometown.  In addition to maintaining the site overall, one day the entire thing went down because Google had a security issue with Magento, the current CMS.  We got rid of Magento in favor of WordPress and things have been mostly stress free since.  I wanted to code the side completely from scratch later, once I got more web development experience, but the owner didn't want me to.  Oh well.

## BYU Software Training

My first long-term job was for [BYU Sofware Training](https://lib.byu.edu/services/software-training/).  I worked there part time from March 2015 to April 2016 teaching people how to use Microsoft Office and Adobe Creative Cloud.  I added to course material, developed courses for new classes, and fixed up the team wiki a lot.  I actually was able to fit in a decent amount of web development, mostly through the classes on Dreamweaver and how to use BYU domains but also in editing the wiki's WordPress code (PHP and CSS).

## FamilySearch

My first internship was at [FamilySearch](https://familysearch.org/).  I didn't know JavaScript when I was interviewed, but I picked it up along with Angular, Polymer, Node, and Git.  Those were my first steps to becoming a web dev guru.  So far FamilySearch is the biggest company I've worked for.

## Prendus

I worked part time at Prendus while taking classes at BYU.  I continued my education in Polymer and learned how to use Redux, TypeScript, and Firebase.  I designed a logo, developed a [style guide](https://github.com/Prendus/style-guide), and built several [reusable components](https://prendus.github.io/style-guide/) for the site.  I was the only one on the team who had a sense of design, so I took the lead on the front end.  Unfortunately, I've noticed that in the time since I've left, no one else has touched (or apparently even heeded) the style guide.  So it goes.

## Interlucid

It was while I was working at Prendus that I formally created the [Interlucid](https://interlucid.com/) project (December 2016).  Interlucid is the most permanent name I've ever had for my [music creations](https://interlucid.bandcamp.com/).  I designed a logo and even printed a couple of [T-shirts](https://interlucid.threadless.com/mens/classic-t-shirt).  I worked pretty solidly in my spare time to make songs, play at open mic nights, learn how to produce, and even learn how to play the guitar. I had a chance to focus 100% of my time on Interlucid after leaving Qualtrics, but after about six months I decided not to continue pursuing it as more than a hobby.

## NUVI

When I worked at [NUVI](https://www.nuvi.com/) I experienced a new facet of web development.  I did my most extensive back end work there, coding a data migration system that translated boolean logic rules from an older specification to a newer one.  I built the core logic in Ruby and worked with Rails to coordinate the various applications involved.  I also learned how to use React so I could build the front end for the migration and fix bugs.

## BYU Computer Science

Continuing my absurd downward wage trend (as I gained more and more experience, each job paid me less and less since FamilySearch) I started working for the BYU CS department as a teaching assistant.  Most of my time was spent trying to be patient with students, correcting horrifying ideas ("Instead of using GitHub.com, you should use a text editor to modify your code" "You mean like Microsoft Word?"), and clarifying facts about the modern web in class.  I had never taken the class when I started but I got hired because of my 1.5 years of experience in the field (which, unsurprisingly, taught me much more than the class ever would have).

## Qualtrics

After graduating and applying to several places, I joined [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/) as a web developer on the marketing team. You could say I'm a WordPress developer, or you could say that me and my small team manage 100s of pages of content over marketing sites in 10+ languages, including animations, forms, downloads, webinars, and more.  I created a style system based on Bootstrap 4 for the team, as well as an auto generating style guide and a system of reusable components for quickly building pages.  I also consolidated the Marketo form system (which previously used around 500 individual forms) to be usable with one global styled form template.

## Connections Museum

I know I'm biased, but the [Connections Museum](https://www.telcomhistory.org/connections-museum-seattle/) is probably the coolest museum in the country, if not the world. It was _working_ telephone switching systems from all different ages of telephony, one which is over a hundred years old! And because they use old technology like relays, wipers, and rods, you can hear them clicking as they complete calls. I volunteer at the Connections Museum primarily as a historian and curator, but also as a maintainer of some of the equipment. To support this effort I created and maintain the [Telecommunications Inventory Wiki](https://wiki.connections.museum/w/Main_Page), which documents items in the museum and provides information about their general use throughout history.
