# Music

While my focus is on adding instrumentation to songs, I also offer a variety of services that can take song production from start to finish including producing, recording, mixing, mastering, and distribution.

You can hear some work from my music project [Interlucid](https://interlucid.com/) on [major services](https://interlucid.com/links/self-aware.html) and [Bandcamp](https://interlucid.bandcamp.com/).  I also remixed [this song](https://soundcloud.com/the-arts-3/so-much) into [this](https://interlucid.bandcamp.com/track/so-much-interlucid-remix).

## Production

If you have a great melody and some guitar or piano chords to go along with it but not sure what else to do with your song, I can help.  I specialize in synthesizers, but I can add drums, bass, and a few other instruments as well.

## Recording

Record vocals, guitars, and more in my studio.  I'll help you get a clean sound.

## Mixing and Mastering

If you want to polish a track for releasing to the public, I can help you get some professional sound out of it.  While I'm building my portfolio, I'm offering heavily discounted rates for mixing and mastering songs.

## Distribution

Once you have a finished track, you'll want to release it on Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play Music, etc.  I can help you find the right aggregator (music platform distributor) to share your music with the world.

## Remixes

Just love my music style and want me to remix your track?  Let me know and I'll whip something up.
