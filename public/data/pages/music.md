# Music

I offer a variety of services that can take song production from start to finish including recording, mixing, mastering, and distribution.

## Recording

My small studio has a condenser microphone, an audio interface, an acoustic guitar, an electric guitar, two keyboards, and an Ableton Push.  If you like you can just rent out the studio for equipment alone.

## Mixing and Mastering

While I'm building my portfolio, I'm offering heavily discounted rates for mixing and mastering songs.  You can hear some of my work on my own music on [major services](https://interlucid.com/links/self-aware.html) and [Bandcamp](https://interlucid.bandcamp.com/).  I also remixed [this song](https://soundcloud.com/the-arts-3/so-much) into [this](https://interlucid.bandcamp.com/track/so-much-interlucid-remix).

## Distribution

Once you have a finished track, you'll want to release it on Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play Music, etc.  I can help you find the right aggregator (music platform distributor) to share your music with the world.
