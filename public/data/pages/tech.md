# Tech

I majored in computer science at BYU and worked at [FamilySearch](https://www.familysearch.org/ask/), [Prendus](https://www.prendus.com/), and [NUVI](https://www.nuvi.com/).  I'm familiar with several front end frameworks and I'm experienced in building applications.  Whether you want to fix a bug on a WordPress site or build an interactive music experience from scratch, I'm your man.

## Websites

I've built the following sites from scratch:

- [This site](/)
- [Interlucid.com](https://interlucid.com/)
- [Web Audio API Tutorial](https://web-audio-api.firebaseapp.com/)
- [Web Synth](http://13.59.194.205:3000/)
- [Simple BYU](https://simple-byu.firebaseapp.com/)

If you want a highly customized site built from the ground up (like these) or even if you want a simpler WordPress, Wix, or SquareSpace site, I can help you out.  This includes purchasing a domain name (like intcreator.com), hosting content, adding music and photos, etc.  I can also fix bugs or annoyances on sites you already have set up.

## Consulting

Not sure where to go or what to do to get started?  I can advise you on the costs and limitations of various tech related ventures.

## Tech Support

Sometimes you just need help setting up some software or maintaining one of your sites.  Chances are my years in the tech industry will be of some use.

## Music

Want some music for your site?  Need some production, recording, or mixing done?  Check out the [music](/music) section for audio related services.
