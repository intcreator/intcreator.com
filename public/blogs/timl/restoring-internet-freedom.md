# Restoring Internet Freedom

_December 4, 2017_

I last posted about Net Neutrality on July 13th, when I did know that much about the subject.  I have since done more research and I am much more at peace with the decision currently being made by the FCC.

As far as I can tell, most of [the FCC's current proposal]( http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1122/DOC-347927A1.pdf)) involves repealing the 500+ page ["Open Internet Order"](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-15-24A1.pdf)  established by the FCC under the Obama administration.  I will explain my understanding of what's actually happening as well as the possible implications.

## Why the "Open Internet Order" might not be that great

### It's difficult to enforce

The "Open Internet Order" is such a large set of regulations it is very difficult to enforce.  Again, it's over 500 pages long (single spaced 8.5 x 11) and most certainly does not read like a novel.  With small companies (yes, there are small service providers) it is understandably hard to justify policing everything they do.

### It can be too restrictive

The "Open Internet Order" includes a lot of regulations that discourage innovation, both because that innovation involves specific actions that are forbidden and because yet again, no one wants to worry about following every rule in a 500+ page document.

## Why the FCC proposal isn't the end of the world

### The "Open Internet Order" didn't change that much in the first place

The FCC's current proposal largely focuses on undoing the "Open Internet Order", which started going into effect in 2010.  Since then it has been added to and the FCC's power over service providers has increased until 2015.  The current proposal will start to limit the FCC's power again.

Before the "Open Internet Order," there were few if any incidents of service providers throttling or filtering content.  It is likely that this will continue to be the case if the proposal passes.

### Threats to net neutrality are mostly theoretical

As cited in the links at the bottom of this post, there are very few concrete incidents in the United States of unethical network administration.  Most speculation about the dystopian future of the internet if the "Open Internet Order" is repealed is purely thatâ€”speculation.  Because the Internet is changing so much and often so unpredictably, policies should be made only after clear needs are identified.  The current FCC proposal is attempting to return to this principle.

### The FCC proposal doesn't free service providers from scrutiny or obeying the law

Service providers will still be required to disclose any throttling or filtering they put into effect, giving consumers the information they need to switch to a more favorable provider if desired.

Service providers will still be subject to investigation and punishment if they are found to be implementing unfair business practices or otherwise taking advantage of consumers.

It is true that without some of the current written regulations the process for prosecuting service providers will work differently.  However, I trust consumers and judges (and if needed, legislators) to recognize unethical actions and to administer appropriate consequences to those responsible.  I simply feel that the "Open Internet Order" is understandably not the best solution.

## Additional Debate

Despite what I've learned, I don't consider the FCC's proposal to be the one and only solution to the issues surrounding net neutrality.  I'm putting my trust in the American legal system to identify future problems as the Internet continues to develop and to address them appropriately.  If strict guidelines for service provider operation are required in the future, I will of course stand behind the decision to implement them.  However, for now, I'm not going to worry.
