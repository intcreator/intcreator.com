# How to study Mormonism scientifically

This is a continuation of the last post, [Why you should study Mormonism scientifically](#).

So you're interested in Mormon culture, ideas, doctrines, motivations, etc.  What can you do to learn more?

## Talk to Mormons

This is the most obvious and possibly the easiest way to know more about how Mormons live their lives.

## Read Mormon books of scripture, commentary, interpretation, etc.

Most of what most Mormons know about their religion they learned from materials that are not only available to the public, they're free to access on [LDS.org](https://www.lds.org/?lang=eng).

### Canon

Their most famous book of scripture is of course the [Book of Mormon](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm?lang=eng).  It's similar to the Bible but it's an easier read and teaches a lot more doctrine in a much smaller span.

Other canonical books include the [Doctrine and Covenants](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament?lang=eng) and the [Pearl of Great Price](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp?lang=eng).  The Doctrine and Covenants is actually a book of modern revelation [dating from 1823 to 1978](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/chron-order?lang=eng).  The Pearl of Great Price provides additional insight to the first several chapters of the Old Testament.

Mormons believe in the [Bible](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bible?lang=eng) as well.  These four books of scripture form their canon.

### General Conference Talks

Mormons believe that prophets like the ones found in the Bible live on the earth today.  The president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, his two counselors, and the quorum of the twelve apostles are all considered by Mormons to be prophets.

Every six months these prophets and other Church leaders hold a [worldwide conference](https://www.lds.org/general-conference?lang=eng) where they discuss God's will concerning current issues in society.  They may make announcements concerning Church-wide policy during these meetings.  Mormons believe their words to be the words of God.

### Manuals, guides, books, and other materials

There are a multitude of resources available to Mormons.  Here is a brief list of just a few.

- [True to the Faith](https://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith?lang=eng) (basic definitions and maxims)
- [Our Search for Happiness](https://amzn.com/0875799175) (a beginners guide to the Plan of Salvation)
- [Our Heritage](https://www.lds.org/manual/our-heritage-a-brief-history-of-the-church-of-jesus-christ-of-latter-day-saints?lang=eng) (A brief history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints)

## Pray to God

If you want to be scientific about your study, you have to experiment.  One experiment recommended to those encountering these doctrines for the first time is given in the closing passages of the Book of Mormon:

> 3 Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.

 > 4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.

 > 5 And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.

> _[Moroni 10:3-5](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.3-5?lang=eng#2)_

You'll want to read that a few times.  Make note of the many requirements you need to fulfill before God will tell you that this is all true.  You need to:

- Ask God, the Eternal Father (address Him as such in your prayer)
- Ask in the name of Christ (mention that you're asking in the name of Jesus Christ in your prayer, which means that you're able to talk to God through Jesus Christâ€”He's our advocate with the Father, but that's a topic for another post)
- Ask if these things are true (you can ask to know if anything taught to you is true, but this particularly refers to doctrines taught in the Book of Mormon [which fortunately happen to be most Mormon doctrines])
- Ask with a sincere heart (not just because someone told you, not as a joke)
- Ask with real intent (you really want to know for yourself, not just to say you did it and not just to fulfill a requirement)
- Have faith in Christ (believe that Jesus Christ is real even though you've never seen Him, and believe enough to do things that will help you learn more about Him and God)

That's a long list.  Receiving an answer from God is not easy.  However, it is possible.

Divine communion is interesting.  Going along with the proofs of God's existence, it's very difficult to prove that divine communion occurred or did not occur.  Therefore every individual must have a personal experience with God in order to gain conviction.

To be honest this isn't too different from scientific fields.  Those who never learn about scientific principles will have more trouble believing they're real than those who study and experiment.

### Feeling self-conscious about praying

I can imagine most people would feel self-conscious about praying to God, especially if they have never done it before and even more especially if they tried it and felt they received no response.  Fortunately, most of us have access to private places where we can pray without anyone else knowing.  This is meant to be a special, personal experience.  It's best to be alone so you aren't distracted or made fun of by others.

We do weird things all the time when we're alone (or at least when we think we're alone) so if praying feels weird, just make sure you're alone first and you'll be fine.

### How will you know that God answered your prayer?

This is a tricky question.  Not only is it different for everyone, it's different depending on the time, place, and subject matter of the prayer.  Often answers come as thoughts, feelings, and ideas.  I can't say I know what you're experience will be, but I can say that when you receive an response, you'll know it.

## Act on what you learned

No doubt through the course of your studies you encountered several invitations to read and study more, to pray, to attend Church meetings, to participate in activities, to do service, to teach, to love other people, and more.  You'll need to experiment and try out these things to see if they're really worth doing.
