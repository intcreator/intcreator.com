# der Bl채tter

On September 2, 2017, Shanti de Ruyter and Brandon Blatter were married in the Los Angeles Temple.  We decided to join our last names together to form **"der Bl채tter"** (**de R**uyter **+** **Blatter**).  We made this decision over the course of several months for the following reasons:

### Single Family Name

We wanted both parents and our children to all have the same last name.  If we chose to each keep our own last name, it would make it more difficult to think of our family as being a single, cohesive unit.

### Honor Both Families

We used letters from both sides of the family.

### Authenticity

We added the umlaut over the a (채) to reflect original German spelling of the word "Bl채tter".

### Creativity

We wanted to make our last name our own.

## Conclusion

We don't want to disrespect any ancestors or relatives on either Brandon's or Shanti's side with the name change.  We hope that by joining our names we can bring the best of both families into our future.
