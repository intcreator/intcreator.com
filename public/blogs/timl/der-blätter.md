# der Blätter

_November 6, 2017_

On September 2, 2017, me (Brandon Blatter) and my wife (Shanti de Ruyter) were married in the Los Angeles Temple.  We decided to join our last names together to form **"der Blätter"** (**de R**uyter **+** **Blatter**, pronounced "**dear** **bleh**•ter").  We made this decision over the course of several months for the following reasons:

### Single Family Name

We wanted both parents and our children to all have the same last name.  If we chose to each keep our birth last name, it would make it more difficult to think of our family as being a single, cohesive unit.

### Honor Both Families

We used letters from both sides of the family so we could make culture and family history from both sides a part of our everyday lives.

### Authenticity

We added the umlaut over the a (ä) to reflect original German spelling of the word "Blätter" (which means leaves).  This umlaut was likely lost when my great great great grandpa Johann Rudolph Blatter moved to the United States.  To this day, most legal systems in the United States do not support umlauts.

### Creativity

We wanted to make our last name our own.  We wanted to try something innovative that would allow us to accomplish our other family name goals.  The name "der Blätter" means "of the leaves" in German.

The name "Brandon" can be traced back to an old Welsh word "breenhin" meaning "prince," making "Brandon der Blätter" translate in English to "prince of the leaves."  Shanti in Sanskrit means "peace," making "Shanti der Blätter" translate in English to "peace of the leaves."

## Conclusion

We don't want to disrespect any ancestors or relatives on either Brandon's or Shanti's side with the name change.  We hope that by joining our names we can bring the best of both families into our future.  We hope you understand and we're willing to answer any questions you might have about our decision.
