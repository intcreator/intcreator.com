    <h1>Biking</h1>
    <p><a href="./">Back</a></p>
    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <p>You should bring the following supplies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bike</li>
      <li>Helmet</li>
      <li>Something to keep your pant leg from getting stuck in your gears (unless you want to shove the fabric into your sock)</li>
      <li>Sunscreen</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Backpack</li>
      <li>Energy dense non-perishable food</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Weather</h2>
    <p>Go biking in whatever you're brave enough to face.  Beginners should stay at home during the snow.  Biking in rain and especially hail kinda sucks.</p>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>Biking is fun as long as you don't get hit by a car or nothing breaks while you're on the road.  Be aware of trails that don't allow bikes.  Look for bike paths and bike lanes when you're in the city.</p>
