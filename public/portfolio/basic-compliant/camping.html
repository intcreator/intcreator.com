    <h1>Camping</h1>
    <p><a href="./">Back</a></p>
    <p><strong>Equipment:</strong> <em>Tent, Rain fly, Stakes, Tarp, Sleeping bag, Flashlight, Matches, Campfire fuel, Water, Backpack, Energy dense non-perishable food (or perishable food if you brought a cooler), Stove (if you want to cook food)</em></p>
    <p><strong>Weather:</strong> <em>Go camping in whatever you're brave enough to face.  Camping in the rain can be fine if you have a waterproof tent/rain fly.  Otherwise you'll be in for a looooooong night.  If it's cold be sure to bring lots of extra clothing and blankets.</em></p>
    <p><strong>The experience</strong>
    <br>Short of animal attacks (including attacks on your food) and mosquito bites, camping is fun.  Be aware that the facilities for showering and extended bathroom trips are usually gross or nonexistent.</p>
    <p>Be sure to bring all the supplies you'll think you'll need.  If you forget something, you may inadvertently make your experience very uncomfortable.</p>
