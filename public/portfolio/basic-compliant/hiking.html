    <h1>Hiking</h1>
    <p><a href="./">Back</a></p>
    <p><strong>Equipment:</strong> <em>Good hiking boots/shoes, Sunscreen, Moleskin, Water, Backpack, Energy dense non-perishable food</em></p>
    <p><strong>Weather:</strong> <em>Go hiking in whatever you're brave enough to face.  Beginners should stay at home during the rain and snow.</em></p>
    <p><strong>The experience</strong>
    <br>Hiking is pretty fun as long as you don't get chased by any wild animals, get lost, or run out of food.  Make sure you can walk at the same pace as the other members of your group.  Otherwise you'll either be left behind or be dragging your feet.</p>
