    <h1>Biking</h1>
    <p><a href="./">Back</a></p>
    <p><strong>Equipment:</strong> <em>Bike, Helmet, Something to keep your pant leg from getting stuck in your gears (unless you want to shove the fabric into your sock), Sunscreen, Water, Backpack, Energy dense non-perishable food</em></p>
    <p><strong>Weather:</strong> <em>Go biking in whatever you're brave enough to face.  Beginners should stay at home during the snow.  Biking in rain and especially hail kinda sucks.</em></p>
    <p><strong>The experience</strong>
    <br>Biking is fun as long as you don't get hit by a car or nothing breaks while you're on the road.  Be aware of trails that don't allow bikes.  Look for bike paths and bike lanes when you're in the city.</p>
